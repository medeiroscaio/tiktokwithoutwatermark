# Download your tik tok video without watermark

The easiest way to download your videos without watermark from tik tok

## 🎯 Goal

Since I was younger, I have always loved watching videos on TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest, especially edits of my favorite TV shows, actresses, actors, and artists.
I used to download these videos to save or post somewhere, but there was always a problem: when downloading directly from the app, the videos came with a watermark and in poor quality. So, I started looking for websites that removed the watermark, but I encountered another issue—although they claimed to provide HD quality, the videos were never truly in HD Coincidentally, at that time, I was learning about some React hooks and APIs, and I thought: Why not build my own solution?
